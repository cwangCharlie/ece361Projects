Entire Transmission Time = time after receiving acknowledgement - time before sending

We tried to send 5 bytes and 9 bytes and obtained 2 Transmission Times. 
Transmission rate = (Transmission Time of 9 bytes - Transmission Time of 5 bytes) / (9 - 5) bytes

Frame Delay of 5 bytes = Trnasmission rate * Frame size = 1000 bits / sec

Propagation delay = (Entire Transmission Time - 2 * Frame Delay) / 2

sim1.o and sim3.o have a similar transmission time under the same size of message.

the transmission time of sim2.o is 4 times of sim1.o
