1. Briefly describe how ping uses ICMP to find out about IP hosts and the
information that it collects.
	ping  uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host
    or gateway. The host name will be entered and connected as the ECHO_REQUEST datagrams have an IP and ICMP 	    	header. 

2. Briefly describe how traceroute uses UDP and ICMP together to determine a
route to a specified host.

	This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet would follow to  some  internet  host  by  launching
    probe  packets  with  a  small  ttl (time to live) then listening for an ICMP "time exceeded" reply from a
    gateway. Some of the methods used could be UDP, ICMP and TCP. We do not want the destination port to use UDP
	probe packets, as this process will set the destination port to a unlikely value

3. Use ping to find values for minimum, average and maximum round trip time to
www.utoronto.ca. Compare this to the min/avg/max round trip time to
www.163.com (free e-mail service in China). What causes the difference in
round trip time to the two servers?

	www.utoronto.ca: 
		60 packets transmitted, 60 received, 0% packet loss, time 59349ms
		rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.783/1.426/12.631/1.741 ms


	www.163.com:
		60 packets transmitted, 60 received, 0% packet loss, time 78120ms
		rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 20.833/22.683/46.586/3.434 ms


	Some of the difference might be caused by the firewalls in China. However, the difference in distance would 	also play an important role in the time aspect. However, it seems like this server is in California, 		 		Therefore, it's faster than the ones in UK

4. The distance from Toronto to China is approximately 10,000 km. If light
travels at 3x10^8 m/s what is the approximate minimum round trip time from
your machine to www.163.com? Compare this to the average round trip time
found in question 1. Explain your findings.

	20000km / 3x10^8m/s = 0.0667s

	The difference in average time is about 20.6s based on the data above. This could be a result of firewalls 		being in place for China's internet. As the security checks will take time to process each pockets sent.

5. Estimate the round trip ping time to www.bbc.co.uk (British News site)?
	The distance from Toronto to UK is approximatly 5600KM
	Assume the speed of light is 3x10^8m/s. The time used should be roughly 0.040s longer than the toronto time.
 
6. Find the actual round trip ping time to www.bbc.co.uk and compare it to your
estimate. Explain your findings.
	60 packets transmitted, 60 received, 0% packet loss, time 59064ms
	rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 77.954/78.399/80.821/0.534 ms
	
	The estimated time it takes is 0.041s or 41ms. However, the actual time is roughly 78 ms. 
	The routing path from Toronto to UK might have gone through many different DNS servers. This makes the direct route calcuation inaccurate than the actual performance. 


7. Find the option in ping which lets you change the packet size. Now ping a
machine with 10 byte packets and repeat for 10,000 byte packets and
compare the round trip times.
	
	16 packets transmitted, 16 received, 0% packet loss, time 15025ms
	rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 23.101/23.916/25.233/0.541 ms

	16 packets transmitted, 16 received, 0% packet loss, time 15024ms
	rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 21.733/22.029/22.784/0.326 ms



8. What is the default packet size for ping?

	56 without the ICMP header. 64 bytes with the header attached 

9. Issue the following command to find the server hosting the Harvard website:
nslookup www.harvard.com
● The first part of the response informs you which DNS server handled your
request
● The second part informs you of the IP address corresponding to the
domain you queried
● What is the IP address of the DNS server you queried and what is the IP
address of the server hosting www.harvard.com?

	Server:		128.100.13.50
	Address:	128.100.13.50#53

	Non-authoritative answer:
	www.harvard.com	canonical name = harvard.com.
	Name:	harvard.com
	Address: 64.64.9.47

	The IP address is 128.100.13.50
	The server hosting it is 64.64.9.47


10. Use the traceroute command to find the # of hops to the DNS server and web
server you found in question #2. What is the reason for the difference in
number of hops? Is the DNS server likely a Local Name Server or a Root Name
Server?
`	The local serve has stored the routes in cache after the first time it's traceroute

	13 hops
	10 hops
	DNS is a Local name server
 1  sf-cad.ece.toronto.edu (128.100.13.254)  0.845 ms  1.809 ms  1.796 ms


11. Use the command: netstat --tcp to find the number of active TCP
connections on your machine.
	20 active connections

12. Open a browser and connect to www.cnn.com. Now issue the same
command as in question 11 and find the TCP entry corresponding to your new
http session. Explain your findings.

	tcp        0      0 ug160.eecg.toront:54958 cnn.com.102.122.2:https ESTABLISHED
	uses http to connect with cnn.com through tcp protocal 

13. Use the command: netstat --statistics to answer the following
questions:
a) How many ICMP echo requests did your machine receive?
	23
b) How many ICMP echo replies did your machine send?
	443
c) How many UDP packets to unknown ports did your machine receive?
	104



14. Use the command: ip addr to find the Ethernet address and IP address of
your machine. What are the addresses?
	
	IP address: 128.100.13.160/24
	Ethernet: 98:90:96:ca:7a:6c

15. Perform an nslookup on the IP address of your machine to determine the
hostname of your machine. What is the hostname?
	ug160.eecg.toronto.edu
	

16. Use the command: ip route show to inspect the local routing table. There
should be two entries. Explain what each of the entries means.

	default via 128.100.13.254 dev eno1 
	128.100.13.0/24 dev eno1 proto kernel 
	scope link src 128.100.13.167 

The first entry is the router address
The second entry represents the network address
The last value is the machine server address.
