Part 1

1. What is the IP address of the host?
	192.168.0.107

2. What is the IP address of the router?
	192.168.0.1

3. What protocol is used to resolve the website domain name?
	DNS

4. What is the IP address of the HTTP server?
	128.100.72.45

5. Which transport layer protocol is used by DNS?
	UDP 

6. Which well-known port is used when contacting the DNS server?
	53

7. Which ephemeral port does the host initiating the DNS query use?
	54883

8. What is the Ethernet address of the host?
	d8:30:62:62::50:5f	

9. What is the Ethernet address of the router?
	00:13:46:a7:d3:02

10. How long does the 3-way handshake take to complete?
	0.025248s - 0.014746 = 0.0105s

11. Which website is the host machine trying to access?
	www.utoronto.ca

12. What version of HTTP is the browser running?
	1.1

13. In the filter box enter the following query: ​ udp.dstport==53 ​ and click apply. What does the
query mean and what are the results?

	The query selects only the transections with destination port of 53. This narrows down the total IP address transfer to DNS transfers. All DNS connections has destination port of 53.

14. Go to ​ Statistics - ​ > ​ Protocol Hierarchy ​ and answer:

A. What percentage of frames are Ethernet frames?
	100%

B. Which transport layer protocols were present and which one made up more of the traffic?
	TCP makes up more of the traffic UDP is also present
	TCP -> 96.7% and 3225 packets
	UDP -> 3.3% and 110 packets
	

15. Now plot the UDP and TCP traffic as follows:
● Go to ​ Statistics -> IO Graph
● Click + ​ ​ and add Display filter: ​ tcp
(Adjust Interval as appropriate)
(Rest of the information can be default)● Click ​ + ​ and add Display filter: ​ udp
(Rest of the information can be default)
● Click + ​ ​ and add Display filter: ​ http and Y Axis: ​ Bits ( ​ Rest of the information can be default)
Answer the following questions:

A. What is the highest number of TCP packets/sec observed? Around what time (second)?
	1330 packets/sec at 1s

B. What is the highest number of UDP packets/sec observed? Around what time (second)?
	73 packets/sec at 3s

C. What is the highest number of HTTP bits/sec observed? Around what time (second)?
	2.232e+5 bits/sec at 1s


Part 2

1. What is the protocol in packet #50 and what is it used for?
	
	SIP/SDP. they are used for streaming and used for multimedia purposes for real-time session.

	SDP is a format for describing streaming media communications parameters. SDP does not deliver any media by itself but is used between endpoints for negotiation of media type, format, and all associated properties. 
	
	SIP is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time sessions that include voice, video and messaging applications.[1] SIP is used for signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions in applications of Internet telephony for voice and video calls, in private IP telephone systems, in instant messaging over Internet Protocol (IP) networks as well as mobile phone calling over LTE (VoLTE). 

	
2. What is the protocol in packet #55 and what is it used for?
	
	RTP. it is used to deliver audio and video over IP networks. Used in communication and entertainment systems.


3. Examine the details of packet #55 and study the “payload type”. What is likely in this
payload?
	
	ITU-T G.711 PCMU (0) Most likely an packet of audio data stored in this session. there is a sequence of audio information in the payload.

4. How much time elapses from packet #55 to packet #1329? How much Bytes has been used
during this period? ​ Hint:​ Use IO Graph to answers these questions
		
	Time: 178.954983 - 166.095301 = 12.859682s

	In IO Graphs, we plot a dot style graph and rtp filter:
	(4*2.15e4 + 4*2.119e4 + 3 * 2.161e4 + 1.926e4 + 1.691e4) = 27.176e4 bytes or 271760 bytes

5. What is going on in this capture?
	
	This is an audio streaming process. 
	It may be an audio conference in which a real time audio interaction(such as phone call) is happening.
