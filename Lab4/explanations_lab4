The use of server in client communication, in comparison to creating new socket between clients, simplifies the handshake method of the creating a TCP connection. In contrast, building a socket for each client provides more privacy and security for the users. 

The concurrency of the server is implemented through the use of select. This mechanisms provides the power to monitor serveral sockets at the same time. 

The concurrency of the server is implemented through the use of multithreads. We create a thread for receiving messages from the server and the main thread is responsible for sending messages.
